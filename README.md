# color-tracker-kidna1
takes live feed from webcam as input and you need to click on certain color to select it and program will automatically highlight simmilar color in the picture ...........sensitivity can be set using slider


this script takes raw input from your webcam so this wont run if you will directly open index.html  to run it you first need to make a local http-server where index.html is stored and then launch using http://127.0.0.1:"port"
